[07/03/25, 7:42:43 AM] Aman Dalmia: With vidly, you can simply enter the link to your youtube video and it provides a chatgpt-style interface where you can directly talk to it while it always retains the full context of the video to answer each question. It also generates meaningful chapters for each video with summaries for you to decide whether to watch a section or skip it.


@gayathri
I had built a non AI version of this many many years ago, a chrome extension which allows you to take notes and mark chapters on a YouTube video. This is next level

@Aman Dalmia few ideas -

See if you can make this into a chrome extension where the chat+sections part replaces the YouTube recommended sidebars. The proper interface can still remain, but whenever you use it with the extension on YouTube itself - that data syncs here. This will reduce a lot of friction (copy paste YouTube link)
some way to take your own notes for each video

@jay
when is chrome extension coming?
