# How to follow instructions

When given instructions to build something, follow these important guidelines:

## Create a Detailed Implementation Plan First
- ALWAYS create a comprehensive implementation plan before writing any code
- Break down the task into specific, actionable steps
- Identify potential edge cases and how they will be handled
- Consider user interactions and experience at each step
- Think through state management and data flow
- Anticipate potential technical challenges and their solutions
- Consider performance implications
- Document any assumptions being made
- Present this plan for review before proceeding with implementation
- Only begin coding after the plan has been established

## Focus on Simplicity
- Implement exactly what is requested without adding unnecessary complexity
- Start with the minimal viable implementation before suggesting enhancements
- Don't create additional pages or components unless explicitly requested

## Respect Existing Choices
- Honor the existing technology stack and version choices
- Don't arbitrarily change or downgrade dependencies
- Work within the established project architecture

## Stay on Task
- Complete one task fully before moving to the next
- Only proceed to additional features with explicit direction
- Keep focus on the immediate requirement

## Avoid Assumptions
- Don't make assumptions about project structure or architecture preferences
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing complex solutions
- Understand the context before suggesting architectural changes

## Test Changes Thoroughly
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- Understand how technologies work together before making changes
- Consider potential side effects of modifications

## Listen Carefully
- Pay close attention to specific requirements and feedback
- Be especially attentive when receiving correction or frustration
- Prioritize the user's explicit needs over perceived "best practices"

## Be Incremental
- Make smaller, focused changes that can be easily reviewed
- Allow for feedback between significant implementation steps
- Build complexity gradually rather than all at once

## Seek Clarification
- Ask questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Confirm understanding before implementing complex solutions
- Propose alternatives only when requested or when there's a critical issue

## Avoid Causing Frustration
- Acknowledge when a solution isn't working and pivot quickly
- Don't persist with an approach that has failed multiple times
- Take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them
- Be honest about limitations in understanding
- Respect the user's time by implementing comprehensive solutions
- Listen to feedback, especially expressions of frustration, as signals to change approach
