      "270.69998 - 280.745: to do something a little different there's a couple of themes there's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as i've listened to you share advice and interview and in talking to people that work for\n",

      "290.85 - 301.41: directly i'm gonna come at these from the side with the many questions that i have for you and the first question i have is something that i've heard people describe at shopify called the toby tornado\n",

      "352.3 - 362.425: a bit whiplashy for people but it's also something that like i mean i certainly hope that's true certainly what people tell me is also what they\n",
      "362.425 - 371.94498: appreciate about a company right like it's kind of like what is best ends up mattering a lot and so yeah basically it's you going into chat room being like hey we're gonna end this project\n",
      "372.44998 - 382.53: let's try something else because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea what i see when i see this is some people complain about this practice of like oh toby kill kills a project we've\n",
      "382.53 - 392.685: been working on my lens is you realize we're just wasting time on this thing that is not gonna work and we shouldn't do it is there anything there along those lines no it's this is\n",
      "392.685 - 402.86: everything it's like look at people again once i imagine something might be not the right thing to work on i'm either incorrect at which point this\n",
      "402.86 - 412.93997: is super important that i understand why or i'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it there's a third way which is like i could also ignore it\n",
      "412.93997 - 423.145: but that's like application of my ceo and founder responsibility that i'm like absolutely not willing to make so that's just not a that's not a path forward that i see valid understand\n",
      "423.625 - 433.89: that's what a lot of people choose to do so yeah like compressing time is important you know like i think we have fairly\n",
      "433.89 - 443.365: limited time in our careers right like and our careers are not that long like it's you know if you're lucky you have forty years in the industry\n",
      "444.965 - 455.26: most people spend more time in school and then like maybe leave later if they're so lucky that i can so it's not even that i think you want to do the maximum\n",
      "455.26 - 465.42: amount of things you can be proud of at the end of your career when you look back you want to be saying like hey holy shit we shipped this thing which was absolutely incredible contribution to a mission i cared about\n",
      "465.42 - 475.945: at a company that was full of other people who cared as much as i did and probably now at my vintage sitting and looking back and also are very proud of working and maybe\n",
      "475.945 - 484.63: even thinking of working with me and being really really glad that we spent time on projects together and so it's like\n",
      "485.99 - 496.035: yeah none of this happens if everyone's sort of optimizing a thing that probably shouldn't be there right therefore i think it's the better thing to do there's another example along these\n",
      "496.035 - 505.95502: lines and by the way love this way of describing of compressing it in time to just make a decision not focus on making it come across the most kind nicest kind of sweetest way\n",
      "506.275 - 516.84: something else i heard along these lines is just when when you give feedback to people when something is not the way that you think it could be or as good as it could be it's often very direct and\n",
      "517.24 - 527.245: often hard to hear and again to me this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential you're trying to push them to do something better is there anything there that you think is a\n",
      "527.245 - 536.96: way of approaching feedback i really really really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to\n",
      "538.48 - 548.48: being at their maximum potential like i just think everyone is like way way way way way better than they think and and the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series\n",
      "548.48 - 558.54504: of ideas maybe certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and therefore we could not take advantage of them very\n",
      "558.54504 - 568.74005: often it's honestly just like it's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things at which point you get stuck competing\n",
      "568.74005 - 578.755: with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious and so i have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to\n",
      "578.755 - 588.675: do and i have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves and now\n",
      "588.915 - 598.94: in a way this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed right know in myself by the way i'm talking about myself here too like i think i have way more\n",
      "598.94 - 609.325: potential than what i bring to bear and i hate that so like i'm trying to cultivate the skills that i need for tomorrow and constantly challenge myself but i like\n",
      "609.325 - 619.42: i'm hard on myself than on anyone else and then i'm by some discount rate act equally to the people around me especially the ones who just so obviously are\n",
      "619.42 - 629.26: brilliant spending longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard\n",
      "629.81995 - 639.895: means that they accomplish often things that just they didn't imagine they could and to me this is the most wonderful thing to see and frankly this is like a through line\n",
      "639.895 - 650.11005: for all of my career because my product is that i want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could and in fact become more ambitious\n",
      "650.11005 - 660.295: about what they are building with their online stores and their businesses than they actually initially set out to do because something like this happened to me right like i started a snowboard store at some point i didn't set\n",
      "660.295 - 670.375: out to build shopify i built shopify because if you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step and optimize\n",
      "670.375 - 680.67: for maximum amount of learning then you choose these steps it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential\n",
      "680.67 - 690.755: and progress and maybe they're not maybe they're not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it like school teaches you that you have to learn\n",
      "690.83496 - 700.995: this particular piece of math in this twelve month period and it doesn't matter how much you understand it it's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you\n",
      "701.21 - 711.29004: on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which like has nothing to do with anything i've ever seen or learned or witnessed about how to actually\n",
      "711.85 - 720.695: learn things you follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth and just\n",
      "722.055 - 731.83997: i find that like in a way shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction and\n",
      "733.68 - 743.865: i've just seen this to come to be true and of course hearing from someone that you respect that hey like i think you\n",
      "743.865 - 753.625: had it in you to do this thing like significantly better because i think you you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of\n",
      "754.05 - 764.20996: path a path b and you chose path b potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right\n",
      "764.20996 - 774.545: thing and like i actually expected better of you and like i expected like i think the next time this happens in your career you should go path like a because\n",
      "774.545 - 784.76: based on your conviction and therefore that's hard to hear right because it's right but it's also extremely valuable and so what\n",
      "784.76 - 794.455: i love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to their actual potential rather than their current level plus some\n",
      "796.695 - 806.855: i don't know bit extra there's so many threads i wanna follow here the example of the school is such a pertinent one to me right now we're looking at preschools for our son\n",
      "806.855 - 817.18: and they're describing their education philosophy i'm like i don't know why i should believe this is the right approach and it makes me just wanna spend all this time researching what education approach works i know it's just preschool\n",
      "817.18 - 826.845: and maybe not as critical yet do you have a bet yet because like i mean obviously i have i have i have three kids too and this is sort of a kind of decision every parent\n",
      "828.045 - 838.16: faces right the interesting business analogy here is so many of your listeners are probably product managers\n",
      "838.16 - 848.305: of machine learning projects that maybe this resonates but like so there's a funny thing about machine learning which you train on a lot of data and hopefully you get something\n",
      "848.625 - 858.625: that predicts the thing you want it to predict correctly out of it the biggest problem of this is overfitting right like so you end up defining a you know what does good look\n",
      "858.625 - 868.72: like a loss function which is a heuristic because it's not the actual task that the thing will do in the future it's something that proxies to the task that you\n",
      "868.72 - 879.055: want the thing to do in the future predict fraud predict the next word whatever so overfitting is basically model learning how to cheat on the benchmark on the fitness function\n",
      "879.21497 - 889.32996: so there's a business analogy of this which is that or not actually analogy it's called goodhart's law it's literally the same thing as overfitting just for businesses goodhart's law just\n",
      "889.32996 - 898.85: says any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric and same exact thing like the\n",
      "899.41 - 909.695: universal truths are things that any almost any competitive field will invent for itself by different terminology often and i think this is also by the way why it's so interesting to\n",
      "909.775 - 920.02: focus on personal growth and and and learning a lot about a lot because you end up finding these sort of hidden harmonies behind things the things that are clearly enduring correct\n",
      "920.02 - 929.235: insights so overfitting gothard's law are the same thing like school optimizes for what what\n",
      "931.795 - 941.315: marks supposedly right like in fact overfitting in school is literally the kids cheating to get marks right like\n",
      "942.66 - 952.66: so you get another analogy what is however the right loss function for children have you made a\n",
      "952.66 - 962.775: decision yet no i have not we just started dems pathway you tell me it's the kind of thing you need to like have to actually go fairly deep in philosophy to figure this out then again afterwards you can build\n",
      "963.015 - 973.17: like you can find the schools that you like i mean just like supplying a risk for us for us it was just maintaining curiosity like this is a completely\n",
      "973.17 - 982.29: different goal from being good at marks but like just think like everyone's born extremely curious and school has a habit of\n",
      "984.20996 - 994.71497: getting it out of kids literally there's a foundation model of a child and you fine tune it on school and like it just like loses the neurons of curiosity because it's like it's actually discouraged\n",
      "994.71497 - 1004.95: to meander into other topics and explore them just because they're interesting i i don't know this is sort of not like the beat of a podcast but like i just think about this a lot it's like it's funny how\n",
      "1004.95 - 1015.10504: these kind of things just recur constantly so when archie was on the podcast he's the head of growth at shopify i don't know if that's his official role basically drives a lot of the growth he\n",
      "1015.10504 - 1025.425: talked about how the core product team outside of the growth team operates without kpis without specific goals and decisions are driven by taste and intuition primarily you and glenn\n",
      "1025.425 - 1035.43: and some other leaders and a lot of people heard that and they're like first i don't believe that second of all how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly what is\n",
      "1035.43 - 1045.515: right and good so the question i have is just how does one operate in that way successfully like what does it take for a company to work that way because a lot of people will try it and fail this is very\n",
      "1045.515 - 1055.71: close to what i just talked about with the overfitting a goodhart's law is real the moment you create like the moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer useful metric right\n",
      "1055.71 - 1065.7899: that's i think more or less a precise wording why because no metric by itself is complete\n",
      "1066.59 - 1076.935: heuristic for a complex business because business is complex there's a million of different tensions in the company and you can't all keep them in harmony by\n",
      "1076.935 - 1086.99: optimizing for one thing so it's true that we don't have kpis and we don't have like at least okrs in the sort of silicon valley sense but we\n",
      "1086.99 - 1096.99: are extremely data informed we have we have invested enormous amounts of money and like money and time into systems that like give us basically\n",
      "1096.99 - 1106.195: everything on our fingertips i sometimes demo this to other founders and they're kind of like completely bought over by the way we can dig into basically every\n",
      "1107.475 - 1117.78: every constituent atomic bit part that makes up the cohort that just just got formed fifteen minutes ago by at the end of a at the end of a quarter\n",
      "1117.78 - 1127.865: or month or week and so so it's actually that what shopify attempts to do is\n",

      "3494.825 - 3505.145: of course like the the really important decisions we don't talk about right so because this is this is the most important thing right like shopify probably makes what millions of decisions every day like like\n",

      "3548.51 - 3558.645: because i think while a lot of decisions are made independently we are a product company we are on a mission\n",
      "3558.645 - 3568.61: and we want our product to feel like something that a single person made like in the same way how any author tries to write a book that clearly reads as that it came from\n",

      "3619.9602 - 3630.04: way of going about it speaking of disagreeing it reminded me of a story i heard about the toby tornado actually the way you operate that and i love it it like ends up being this interesting microcosm\n",
      "3630.04 - 3640.085: of of your first principles way of thinking so the story is i think you've said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to\n",

      "3691.3801 - 3701.385: vision this actually reminds me of something that came up basically every time i had someone from shopify on which is this idea of a hundred year vision that you keep i don't know of\n",

      "5845.985 - 5856.76: not possible to make great products if the people who work on it do not give a shit about the product and i actually think this is a very important role for product\n",

      "5920.15 - 5930.165: like you just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else because that's that's the role now you don't have to do this by\n",
      "5930.165 - 5940.18: yourself like everyone is on the team is of a resource to you and you can query them and therefore determine what is around\n",
      "5940.18 - 5950.545: the corners and so on but like in engineering ux and so on but that's very important and then the second is like it's you've got to be exophermically\n",
      "5950.545 - 5959.9053: infectious with like actually caring about this thing because just that one thing alone will make a ten times better product it's crazy\n",

      "5970.9497 - 5980.625: giving a shit being exothermic excited and looking around corners i feel like this is its own conversation here yeah agree i don't think phaunomode so i mean i think\n",
      "5982.065 - 5992.64: yeah phaunomode is a super valuable term but i actually do think that it's like i i answered a question about what i think about founder mode in the discussion\n",
      "5992.64 - 6002.795: about pumping heat into systems like this this is my like that's what i do it's it's just that founder mode like the founder run company i think this has an easier\n",
      "6002.795 - 6012.795: time existing because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing you know people fight them people protect them out and if the boss is\n",
      "6012.795 - 6023.0596: like this boss can protect other people like this and therefore i think founder owned companies can be innovative longer because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing\n",
      "6023.0596 - 6033.485: for a long time so anyway that's my sort of tldr on the founder mode discussion which i think is an interesting like really fascinating discussion it's find\n",
      "6033.485 - 6043.485: it's very valuable i'm i'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways but like i think it's more actionable than people think toby i appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets even though i know you have to\n",
